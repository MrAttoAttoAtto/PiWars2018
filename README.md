# PiWars2018
Code for the most powerful machine.

This is the code for the Robot Apocalypse Committee's robot which will be entered in PiWars2018. I'm not sure why anyone would be reading this, because it's a private repo and all of us know what this is but sure.

Here is some handy info for what the challenges are, what they need etc. so you don't have to check the PiWars website again.

Straight-Line Speed Test:<br />
  - MODE: AUTONOMOUS<br />
  - REQUIRES: proximity sensor, camera, and 2 driving motors<br />
  - ENTAILS: Robot must travel about 7 meters (~24 feet), making small variations in motor speeds                   based off data from proximity sensor and camera looking for line, so that it stays going               straight.

The Minimal Maze:<br />
  - MODE: AUTONOMOUS<br />
  - REQUIRES: proximity sensor, camera, 2 driving motors<br />
  - ENTAILS: Robot must travel through a course with widths of ~36cm, deciding where it is in the                   course from the colors of the walls it sees, and the data from the proximity sensor.

Somewhere Over the Rainbow:<br />
  - MODE: AUTONOMOUS<br />
  - REQUIRES: proximity sensor, camera, 2 driving motors<br />
  - ENTAILS: Robot needs to look around, determining which corners have which colored balls. It then                needs to determine it's path, and visit each corner in the (predetermined) order as                    quickly as possible.

Slightly Deranged Golf:<br />
  - MODE: CONTROLLED<br />
  - REQUIRED: remote control system, ball holding rig and 2 driving motors.<br />
  - ENTAILS: Robot should trap the ball (such that ball can still roll, but cannot escape the robot.)               Then, it should navigate swiftly to the hole, releasing the ball and pushing it into the               hole.

Pi Noon:<br />
  - MODE: CONTROLLED<br />
  - REQUIRED: remote control system, attachment point for balloons, NOICE control system, 2 driving        motors.<br />
  - ENTAILS: Maneuver the bot to poke other balloons. Agility is key.

The Obstacle Course:<br />
  - MODE: CONTROLLED<br />
  - REQUIRED: remote control system, good handling, good grip<br />
  - ENTAILS: Navigate an obstacle course quickly. That's about it

The Duck Shoot:<br />
  - MODE: CONTROLLED<br />
  - REQUIRED: remote control system, easy moving horizontally (possibly an auto strafe), flywheel and                nerf darts<br />
  - ENTAILS: Shoot down 5 smol target with nerf darts (within a large time limit)<br />

Blogging:<br />
  - Basically just post things on wordpress every now and then.<br />

Technical Merit:<br />
  - Make sure nothing is too dodgy<br />

Artistic Merit:<br />
  - This is wholly irrelevant until we have functionality, but once we do, I guess just make it look       niceish
